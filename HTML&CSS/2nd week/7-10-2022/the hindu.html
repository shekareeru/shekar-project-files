                            'The truth is, India have been timid in World Cups, they go into a shell': Nasser Hussain ahead of T20 World Cup

                            Former England captain Nasser Hussain said India have been 'timid' in ICC tournaments which is the main reason behind them not winning a World Cup since 2011.
                            India have been a powerhouse in bilaterals this year, equalling Australia's world record for most wins in a calendar year with two months still to go. India, so far, have won 38 matches this year and with the T20 World Cup and tours to New Zealand and Bangladesh to follow, that number is only set to rise. And this is not the trend for this year only. India have been dominant across formats for the last four-five years - they had won 37 matches in 2017. They have won in New Zealand, England and Australia and have been almost unbeatable at home but despite all this, their performance in multi-nation tournaments have been below-par.

                                Captain Rohit Sharma was nowhere to be seen during India's second warm-up tie against Western Australia at the WACA on Thursday. Rohit's no-show was all the more surprising given the India captain's name had been listed in the Playing XI. Instead, it was KL Rahul, who was named the official captain for the tie as India lost to WA by 36 runs. Chasing 169 to win, India finished on 133/7 in 20 overs with the batters putting in an average show. Despite the Indian batting crumbling against, Rohit did now show up, which left the fans irate.

                                Former India captain Sourav Ganguly ended silence over his BCCI tenure with a rather cryptic remark as he took part in an event on Thursday. It was reported earlier this week that Ganguly will not have a second term as the president of the board, and that former India cricketer Roger Binny will instead succeed Ganguly in the role. The 50-year-old Ganguly became the president of BCCI in 2019.
